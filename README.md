# WorkSync Project

## Project Overview
WorkSync is a multi-part application that includes several components, each serving a specific purpose. The system leverages multiple services such as the frontend, backend, workers, and processors. This repository contains the core logic for processing data, managing backend services, handling frontend interactions, and executing background tasks.

### Detailed Structure:

1. **Frontend**
    - Contains the UI built using Next.js with Tailwind CSS.
    - Pages for login, signup, and dashboard.
    - Reusable components for the app’s interface (e.g., `appbar.tsx`, `hero.tsx`).
  
2. **Hooks**
    - Manages custom hooks for shared logic across services.
    - Includes Prisma migrations and schemas for database interactions.

3. **Primary Backend**
    - Core backend logic using TypeScript.
    - Prisma used for database management.
    - Includes routes, middlewares, and types for user authentication, zaps, triggers, and actions.

4. **Processor**
    - Manages background job processing and database interaction.
    - Built with TypeScript, and uses Prisma for handling job-specific data migrations.

5. **Workers**
    - Worker processes that handle asynchronous tasks.
    - Built with Prisma and TypeScript, defining schema and worker logic.

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/WorkSync.git
   cd WorkSync
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Each component has its own `package.json`. Install dependencies for each by navigating into each directory (e.g., `frontend`, `primary-backend`, etc.) and running:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Database Setup**:
   This project uses Prisma for database management. Make sure to configure your `.env` file with database credentials and run the following command in each service:
   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate dev
   ```

4. **Run the Application**:
   To start the app, you can use the provided shell script or manually start each component:
   ```bash
   ./shell.sh
   ```

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Next.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, Prisma, TypeScript
- **Database**: Prisma ORM (supports PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.)
- **Job Processing**: TypeScript, Workers
- **Package Management**: npm
